	<p>a Fruit Sando which is also known as a Japanese fruit sandwich. Now <em>Sando</em> is which is one of Japanese popular snacks which can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, and even snacks. Sandos are made from simple ingredients like soft white bread filled with whipped cream and chunks of fresh seasonal fruit such as strawberries.</p>
	<p> The Fruit Sando dates back to the 1920s, where they served it in Japanese coffee shops and caf&eacute;s. They were served in a form of a classic sandwich which had thin slices of fruit inside. But it wasnâ€™t until years later in the present day until today it was made popular again through social media. They say that the fruits within the sandwich are arranged in a form of artistical combinations and when split open can reveal a creative visual. </p>
